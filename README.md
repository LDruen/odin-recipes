# odin-recipes
Before project:
The is the final project assignment of the HTML Foundations portion of the Odin Project. The goal of this assignment is to build a small recipes website.

During project:
I'm going to use recipes/pictures from allrecipes.com to save the time of not having to make my own recipes. All recipes used on here are based off of recipes of the same name on allrecipes.com, and are 100% NOT my own.
